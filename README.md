Set up a ClojureScript web server in one command using [sitefox](https://github.com/chr15m/sitefox) and [nbb](https://github.com/borkdude/nbb).

```shell
npm create sitefox-nbb mywebsite
cd mywebsite
npx nbb server.cljs
```

Then open `server.cljs` in your editor and start hacking. 👍

See the [sitefox documentation](https://github.com/chr15m/sitefox#batteries-included) for details on what you can do next.
